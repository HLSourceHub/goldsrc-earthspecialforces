To open the old style bot menu press the "=" key
If it does not work type this in console (hit the ~ key):

bind "=" "bot_menu"

To open up the new style menu press the "SHIFT" key
If it does not work type this in console (hit the ~ key):

bind "SHIFT" "+commandmenu"

Of course you can change "=" and "SHIFT" to any key you want
(usually a key that is unused) to launch the bot menu.

Both menu's allow you to use most of the bot commands.

For remaining commands check the manual which is found here:
(half-life\esf\ESF_Bot\manual).

Note for all Dedicated server owners: all console commands will work, 
but you must type esf_bot4 before each command.
