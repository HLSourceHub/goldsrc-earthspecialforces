<h3><font size=+5>FAQ</font></h3>
<p>Here are some frequently asked questions and answers:<br></p>


<p><font size=+2><b>General Questions</b></font></p>

<strong>What can the bots do?</strong><br>
Read it <a href="history.htm" target="_self">here</a>, you must have missed it when you carefully read this documentation.;-)<br><br>

<strong>Is there an official site</strong>?<br>
Yes there is, it's part of the official site! <a href="http://www.esforces.com/bot/" target="_blank">ESForces Bot site</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<font size=+2><b>Bugs, Solutions and TroubleShooting</b></font><br><br>

<strong>The bots use &lt;insert something like melee here&gt; to much</strong><br>
Open the botpersonality editor(esf\esf_bot\BotEdit.exe) to change the bots behaviour.<br><br>

<strong>Bots can swoop slow when the bot is created after a sbot is kicked, metamod is installed.</strong><br>
Restart the server.<br><br>

<strong>Super Bots crash.</strong><br>
How unpleasant. They are experimental, if you don't want them to crash, don't use them.<br><br>

<strong> Esf_battlearena sometimes crashes</strong><br>
We know, we currently have no good solution, we are working on it.<br><br>

<strong>The bots own me!</strong><br>
You could try to change the botskill or the melee percent to a lower value<br><br>

<strong>I own the bots!!! W00t w00t!</strong><br>
You should set the bot skill to best (botskill 1), melee percent to 80% (bot_melee_percent 80) and<br>
the teleport percent to 100% (bot_teleport_percent 100), then we'll talk again.<br>
Note: you could also change the skill.cfg file, you are able to tailor the skills of bots even more.<br><br>

<strong>I still own the bots!!! W00t, w00ter, W00test!</strong><br>
Try the super bots.<br><br>

<strong>I get an error about a missing dll .</strong><br>
Not you too?! you need <a href="http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvbvm60" target="_blank">msvbvm60.dll</a>, this will fix all your problems :-)<br><br>

<font size=+2><b>Other Questions</b></font><br><br>

<strong>When will the new version of Earth's Special Forces come out?</strong><br>
When its done, the ESF team is not working on Earth's Special Forces as a fulltime job you know, these<br> people have something called a "life". :-P<br><br>

<strong>When will the new version of ESF bot come out?</strong><br>
When its done, [Me], the creator has to code the bots in his own spare time.<br> Maybe there is a new version out right now! check either <a  href="http://www.esforces.com" target="_blank">www.esforces.com</a> or at the <a href="http://forum.esforces.com/forumdisplay.php?f=31" target="_blank">Esf bot forum</a> for<br> new versions.<br><br>

<strong>This bot sux! I'll never use it again!</strong><br>
That's your loss.<br><br>

<strong>This bot suxx0r, even i can make a better bot!! W00t R0XX0RZ
MY B0XX0RZ!</strong><br>
Then what's stopping you?
