***Chat files for the ESF Bots***

Any lines before the bot_chat, bot_taunt and bot_whine will be ignored.
Also lines starting with # will be ignored, no matter where it is placed.
Basic format of this file goes as follows:

* = Sub-heading
** = Heading
*** = Title

Read the following to understand how to create a 'Chat Block' and use this
file to create or modify 'Chat Blocks' (found at very bottom).

**Purpose:**
To advance the bot's speech by not only making them say random phrases but
also respond to another player\bot's questions\phrases.


**Explaination:**
In this file you can modify/add chat sentences and add/modify chat replies.

*IMPORTANT*
Remember that Advanced Chat ONLY WORKS IN THE BOT_CHAT SECTION! If used in any
other section (bot_whine and bot_taunt) it WILL NOT WORK.

**Chat Sections Explained:**

bot_welcome:
When a player joins a game, anything placed under this heading will be said by a bot.
The percentage a bot will say a welcome message when a player joins a game is always 50%.

bot_chat:
This section contains 'normal' chat sentences. These sentences will be used randomly.
You can also put response sentences in this section.

bot_whine:
Anything put in this section is used when a bot wants to 'whine' after they are killed.

bot_taunt:
This chat section is used for when a bot wants to 'taunt' the player they were killed by.

**Key Definitions:**

Chat Block:

The name of all the components (Phrases, Responses, KeyTone\KeyWord\KeyWord2) as one
group. An example of a basic 'Chat Block' is defined below:

KeWord Hi, Hello
{
	Yo
	Hey
}

Chat Type:

The type of chat the 'Chat Block' will follow (either KeyWord, KeyWord2 or KeyTone).
Each of these 'Chat Types' are explained below.

Phrase:

The word(s)\symbol(s) that follow a 'Chat Type'.  If the word(s) or symbol(s) is\are 
said by a player or a bot ingame then another bot will respond with whatever response
is inside the 'Chat Blocks' parameters. You can have a maximum of 6 'Phrases' per 
'Chat Block'. You separate a 'Phrase' with a comma or a space (or both). Like so:

Phrase 1, Phrase 2, Phrase 3, Phrase 4, Phrase 5, Phrase 6

What one could look like:

Hi, Hey, Yo, Hello, Sup, Heyo

or (using only spaces)

Hi Hey Yo Hello Sup Heyo

or (using only comma's)

Hi,Hey,Yo,Hello,Sup,Heyo

Response:

A 'Response' is what the bot will say when a 'Phrase' is said ingame. Remember that this doesn't
work every time unless your 'bot_chat_percent' variable is set to 100. Usually a 'Response' will
be related to one of the 'Phrases'. A 'Response' has a maximum of 80 characters (if you have any
more then they will be cut off\truncated).  There can be a maximum of 100 'Responses' for each 
'Chat Block'.  Any 'Responses' past 100 are ignored. For advanced response option see the heading:
'Response Usage'.

**Chat Block Template:**

The setup of a 'Chat Block' is fairly simple. Use the definitions above to find out what each
part means. The template is below:

Chat Type Phrase
{
	Response
	Response
	Response
}

**KeyWord Usage:**

When you use the 'Keyword' heading bots will reply when a 'Phrase' is used ingame using a 'Response'
inside the 'Chat Block' (the '{' and '}' brackets). When a bot searches for a matching 'Phrase' when
something is said ingame it divides the words up with spaces and certain characters 
(listed here: " ,.;:[](){}-=+*-/\\<>?!@#$%%^&" any of these will be ignored or used to divide up words).

Example:

Ingame Speech: haha :D

KeyWord haha, lol
{
	Whats so funny!
	hehe
}

In this example if you or a bot say "haha nice one" another bot might say back "hehe" or
"Whats so funny!". The bot will ignore the ":D" because it is one of the characters used to
divide up words (so basically it sees it as nothing, just like a space).

**KeyWord2 Usage:**

'KeyWord2' is just like 'KeyWord'. The difference is when the bot is searching for a 'Phrase' he doesn't
ignore special characters (" ,.;:[](){}-=+*-/\\<>?!@#$%^&\n\r\t"). Unlike 'KeyWord' the special characters
are seen words and not dividers.  So you can now have a bot respond when a special character is used like so:

Example:

Ingame Speech: omg :)

KeyWord2 :), :-)
{
	:P
	hehe
}

In this example if you or a bot say ":)", another bot might react with ":P" or "hehe".

**KeyToken Usage:**

Use this if you want to a bot to respond to a single character\token. The 'KeyToken' heading
does not divide up words. It just searches for the one character\token whenever someone says
something. There are no character limits with this 'Chat Type' but you can't have more than
one character per 'Phrase' (so you can't do "??" but you can do "?").

Example:

Ingame Speech: What was that?

KeyToken ?
{
	What?
	Why do you ask?
}

In this example a question mark is placed as the 'Phrase' (the '?' character). The bot will respond with 
"What?" or "Why do you ask?" when a question mark is used ingame.

**Response Overview:**

If you don't use ! at the beginning of a sentence (see 'Response Options') the bot will 'humanize' the sentence.
They can lowercase a sentence, drop random characters and swap characters. How much they will do this is
specified by the variables 'chat_lower_percent', 'chat_drop_percent' and 'chat_swap_percent'. You can change these
for each personality in the file 'bot_personality.cfg'. Furthermore the bot will 'humanize' any names used 
in the sentence. They can remove clan tags (ie [ESF]L33TGuY is his name then the [ESF] is dropped and the bot will say 
L33tGuY instead). The amount of times a bot will do this is specified in the 'chat_tag_percent' variable in the 
bot_personality file.


**Response Options:**

If one of the following comes before a 'Response' it will give that 'Response' special functions:

!  		:  	When used the bot won't modify the chat sentence, so it doesn't drop characters
			or lowercase letters.
UV: XXX		:	When used, you set the 'Use Value' of the sentence. Replace the XXX with a number
			(range: 0 - 100 Default: 50), the higher the value, the more chance the bot will
			use it over other 'Responses' in the 'Chat Block'.

**Using A Player's Name:**

In a 'Response' you can use %n or %r to represent a player's ingame name. When a bot says the 'Response' ingame
it will replace %n or %r with the players name.  The rules on how to use the two functions are:

The %n function can be used to hold the place of:

	-The name of a bot (when used in a random sentence, only in 'bot_chat')
	-The name of the player the bot is responding to (if Joe said "Hi" the bot could say "Hi Joe", only used in 'bot_chat')
	-The name of a player who killed the bot (used only in the 'bot_whine' section)
	-The name of a player who was killed by the bot (used only in the 'bot_taunt' section)

The %r function can be used to hold the place of:
	
	-A random player's name (any section)
